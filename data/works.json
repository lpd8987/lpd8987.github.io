                "description": "This is a passion project I have been working on since September 2022 that originated from a silly idea I had one day while brainstorming. The project is built using open source assets from the Unity Asset Store as well as many of my own creation. My assets include: animated and textured 3D models using Blender, and smooth and thematic UI using Adobe Illustrator. The current prototype has been playtested, but there is still a lot of room for improvement that is currently underway.\nAdditionally, I have been overhauling the scripts from the original prototype to be more cohesive as well as developer friendly. Namely, scripts are now broken up more appropriately, many settable variables in the inspector have descriptor headers, and the code includes more comments. Check back frequently for updates as March 2023 will be a very development heavy month!",
